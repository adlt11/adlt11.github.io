	<h1 class="proj_title">Overview</h1>
	<p class="info">Redesigning some main aspects of <a href="https://www.shopblt.com" target="blank">BottomLineTelecommunications (BLT)</a>
			to improve the online purchasing experience.</p>

 	<p class="info">Working in a team, we sought out to navigate through different pages of the website and discover pain points that a user
			might encounter. Using the website as is, and being mindful of familiarity for returning customers, our team focused on
			efficiency and ease-of-use.</p>

	<!--
	THIS IS THE NEXT SECTION AFTER THE OVERVIEW SECTION. IT EXPLAINS BOTH THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION OF THE PROJECT. 
	-->

	<h1 class="proj_title">The Problem</h1>
	<p class="info"><a href="https://www.shopblt.com" target="blank">BottomLineTelecommunications</a> is an e-commerce website that provides
			its customers with over 300,000 hardware and software solutions manufacturers all over the world. However, the latest
			incarnation of its website feels outdated and user-unfriendly.

<br>

	<h1 class="proj_title">The Solution</h1>
	<p class="info">Navigate through <a href="https://www.shopblt.com" target="blank">BottomLineTelecommunications</a> and figure out which
			aspects influence the purchasing experience the most. In other words, which pages would users most benefit from a redesign.
			After conducting some research, we discovered the pages and concepts were:
								<ul class="info">
			    		    				<li>Customer support and contact information page</li>
			    		    				<li>Product discovery (homepage, search listings) page</li>
			    		    				<li>Product filtering</li>
			    		    				<li>Product check out</li>
									<li>Search bar</li>
								</ul>

	THIS IS THE NEXT SECTION AFTER THE PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE DESIGN PROCESS OF THE PROJECT IN 5 STEPS. STEP 1 IS RIGHT BELOW THIS SECTION AND IT EXPLAINS THE INITIAL STEPS WE TOOK TO BEGIN THE PROJECT. 
	-->

	<h1 class="proj_title">The Design Process</h1>
	<h2 class="list_headers">1. User Research</h2>
	<p class="info">To fully uncover the usability issues of the website, we conducted several research methods. Each method, as we studied along,
			revealed crucial insights about the website:
						<ul class="info">
			    		    		<li>Competitive analysis - allowed for us to get a sense of who the site's competitors were,
							    both on and offline.</li>
			    		    		<li>Personas - went further into the website user base and specify three different kinds of
							    customers.</li>
			    		    		<li>Surveys - had five broad objectives in mind, to determine the preferences customers had.</li>
			    		    		<li>Interviews - go further into the preferences of users and discover a more personal touch
							    to online purchasing.</li>
						</ul>

	THIS IS STEP 2 OF THE 5 STEP DESIGN PROCESS SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE NEXT STEPS WE TOOK IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROJECT. 
	-->

	<h2 class="list_headers">2. Data Analysis</h2>
	<p class="info">Survey & Interview insights:</p>
	<p class="info">When it came to hardware purchases, there was a convenience factor for people to shop in-store rather than online, due to
			frustration from the process of online shopping. People occasionally have difficulty finding product online and product
			research was crucial to them. Therefore product results were the make-or-break point for people.<br> A good search bar formula
			would be beneficial towards a more user-friendly consumer products site.</p>

	<h2 class="list_headers">3. Sketches</h2>
	<p class="info">Using a whiteboard and a marker, we worked collaboratively to approach different design ideas based on the five pages mentioned
			in "The Solution" section. This helped us mix-and-match different ideas and allowed us to work much faster.</p>

	<h1 class="proj_title">Takeaways</h1>
	<p class="info">This was my first HCI project, but my second project course. Comparing it to my first, I definitely did a lot
	more research and contributed to a lot more design concepts. It all came down to gaining more experience in working on group
	projects and learning the different methods of research we must conduct in order to get the data we need.</p>

	<p class="info">In the future, I would like to take this project further and make it into a mobile version. I would conduct more
	interviews and maybe even try some different testing, like A/B testing, to get richer feedback. Given that we are increasingly
	growing into a tech-based world, it's important that we consider making tech services more efficient for users.</p>
