	<h1 class="proj_title">Overview</h1>
	<p class="info">Redesigning <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a>
			to an entirely new website, to try and reach its full potential.</p>

	<p class="info">Working in a team, we wanted to create a better version of
			<a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> by focusing
			on the aesthetics of the site. We would use and consider some of the website
			aspects as is, but add some aspects of our own as well. The idea was to create
			a whole new website, our own version of <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet.</a></p>

	<!--
	THIS IS THE NEXT SECTION AFTER THE OVERVIEW SECTION. IT EXPLAINS BOTH THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION OF THE PROJECT. 
	-->
	<h1 class="proj_title">The Problem</h1>
	<p class="info"><a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> is a scheduling
			tool website that is meant to aid people with different time schedules, find
			availability with a combined time schedule. However, the current version of
			<a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> feels old and
			has a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<br>

	<h1 class="proj_title">The Solution</h1>
	<p class="info">Use <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> and compare it
			to other scheduling websites. We tried to incorporate some outside ideas that would
			make sense with a scheduling website. Also, it was important we take note of the
			aesthetics for users. After conducting some research, we knew we had to incorporate
			the following changes:
					<ul class="info">
			    		    <li>Change the current aesthetics of the website (color, font, etc.)</li>
			    		    <li>Have a home page for events</li>
			    		    <li>Add an event and member page</li>
			    		    <li>Add more ways to share events (i.e. text messaging)</li>
					</ul>

	THIS IS THE NEXT SECTION AFTER THE PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE DESIGN PROCESS OF THE PROJECT IN 4 STEPS. STEP 1 IS RIGHT BELOW THIS SECTION AND IT EXPLAINS THE INITIAL STEPS WE TOOK TO BEGIN THE PROJECT. 
	-->
	<h1 class="proj_title">The Design Process</h1>
	<h2 class="list_headers">1. User Research</h2>
	<p class="info">Our main method of user research was a survey. The survey was aimed towards finding the
	current likes/dislikes of <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet.</a> Other research
	conducted was based on our own personal knowledge of previous classes, such as functional requirements of
	the website and use case diagrams.</p>

	THIS IS STEP 2 OF THE 4 STEP DESIGN PROCESS SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE NEXT STEPS WE TOOK IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROJECT. 
	-->
	<h2 class="list_headers">2. Data Analysis</h2>
	<p class="info">Survey insights:</p>
	<p class="info">When it came to the login process and sense of reliability from the website, people had no
	problem with these two aspects. However, when it came to the layout of the website users would agree that
	fonts/colors could be improved on the site. Along with that, the methods used to input individual schedules
	could be improved. The overall processes that the website had users involved in, were easy enough to understand.</p>

	-->

	<h2 class="list_headers">3. Wireframes</h2>
	<p class="info">After conducting user research and gathering data, we decided to make our first few wireframes
	of the website. These wireframes incorporated both our own outside ideas and a change in aesthetics.</p>

	<h1 class="proj_title">Takeaways</h1>
	<p class="info">This was my first redesign project and my first project course overall. All in all, I believe my group and I
	did good considering that we came up with a whole new product. If we had more time, I'm sure we could've conducted more research
	methods and more design concepts. Overall, the experience I gained during this time was worth-while; it only gets better from here.</p>

	<p class="info">In the future, I would like to take this project further and conduct much more research than what we did here. I
	would definitely incorporate some interviews in the project, as well as having some users test the product for aesthetics. I believe
	part of having a successful product is having good aesthetics for users.</p>
