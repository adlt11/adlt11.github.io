	<h1 class="proj_title">Overview</h1>
	<p class="info">Redesigning <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a>
			to an entirely new website, to try and reach its full potential.</p>

	<p class="info">Working in a team, we wanted to create a better version of
			<a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> given that as it 
			stands, it could benefit from a redesign. We wanted to primarily focus on the aesthetics
			of the site, since most of the siteâ€™s functionalities were heading in the right direction.
			Going into it, we had a strong sense that what drove users away the most was its visuals;
			it was old and unappealing, almost skeptical in a way. In the end, the idea was to create
			a whole new website, our own version of <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet.</a></p>

	THIS IS THE NEXT SECTION AFTER THE OVERVIEW SECTION. IT EXPLAINS BOTH THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION OF THE PROJECT. 
	-->
	<h1 class="proj_title">The Problem</h1>
	<p class="info"><a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> is a scheduling
			tool that takes in time schedules from a group of people and produces one big, combined 
			schedule. Using this, people can specifically view what time slots all the people in their group are available. As previously mentioned, although the concept and functionality of this website is good, the current version of <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> feels outdated and has a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<br>

	<h1 class="proj_title">The Solution</h1>
	<p class="info">Use <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> concurrently
			with other scheduling websites and compare their usability. We would then incorporate
			ideas we believed worked well with a scheduling website, as well as take note of the aesthetics. Much of the decisions we made were based on user-research and after gathering
			some evidence, we concluded that we needed to incorporate the following changes:
					<ul class="info">
			    		    <li>Change the current aesthetics of the website (color, font, etc.)</li>
			    		    <li>Include a home page for different events</li>
			    		    <li>Aggregate an event and member page, that lists the different members 	and events a user has</li>
			    		    <li>Extend the capability for sharing events (i.e. text messaging)</li>
					</ul>

	-->
	<h1 class="proj_title">The Design Process</h1>
	<h2 class="list_headers">1. User Research</h2>
	<p class="info">Our main method of user-research was a survey. The survey was aimed towards discovering what the current likes/dislikes of <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet</a> were. Other research conducted was based on our own personal knowledge from previous courses, such as functional/nonfunctional requirements for the website and use-case diagrams.</p>

	THIS IS STEP 2 OF THE 4 STEP DESIGN PROCESS SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE NEXT STEPS WE TOOK IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROJECT. 
	-->
	<h2 class="list_headers">2. Data Analysis</h2>
	<p class="info">Survey insights:</p>
	<p class="info">When it came to the login process and a sense of reliability from the website, people had no problem with these two aspects. However, when it came to the layout of the website users agreed that fonts/colors could be improved. Along with that, the methods used to input individual time schedules had room for improvement. The overall processes users were involved with, were easy enough to understand.</p>

	THIS IS STEP 3 OF THE 4 STEP DESIGN PROCESS SECTION. IT EXPLAINS THE FINISHING TOUCHES WE MADE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. 
	-->

	<h2 class="list_headers">3. Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
	<p class="info">After conducting user research and gathering data, we decided to make our first few wireframes of the website. These low-fidelity wireframes incorporated a big change in aesthetics, as well as our own personal ideas. We created our own logo and added new pages aside from <a href="https://www.when2meet.com" target="blank">When2Meet's</a> default ones. This is what we believed the functional prototype should look like in the end.</p>

	<h2 class="list_headers">4. High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
	<p class="info">Some time after the project class was over, I decided to go back and create high-fidelity wireframes, from the low-fidelity ones, using Sketch. I had just obtained Sketch and thought it would be good practice for me to do so. Also using Sketch, I was able to use its basic prototyping functionalities to link different pages within the project; so clicking a button on one page can redirect you to the according page. Given that it was my first time, I would say it didn't go too bad.</p>

	<h1 class="proj_title">Takeaways</h1>
	<p class="info">This was my first redesign project and my first project course overall. All in all, I believe my group and I did good considering the project time and scope we were given. In the end, we came up with some sort of visuals using the research data we were able to gather. If we had more time, I'm sure we would've conducted new research methods to gather more data and propose new design concepts as well. Overall, the research and design experience I gained during this time was worth-while; it only got better from here.</p>

	<p class="info">In the future, I would like to take this project further and conduct much more research than what was done here. Additional to that, I would also like to create a functional prototype of the project. I would definitely incorporate some interviews in the project, as well as having some users test the product for aesthetics. I believe the success factor for this project is having good aesthetics.</p>
